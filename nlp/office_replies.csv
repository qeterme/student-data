2326,"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put ’em in a room, and you just- Hey.",Hey.,Pam

4656,I can’t…,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don’t know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn’t even a stopwatch. It’s a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you’re going to beat Toby.",Pam
4657,"Well I, I, I came here in a cab.",Perfect.,Michael

4710,And a soy sauce packet.,Oh! That shouldn’t have been in there. I’m embarrassed.,Dwight
4711,I do gamble Michael.,"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don’t know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.

4741,"Hey Pam, we’re going to Poor Richards. Creed’s buying shots.","No thanks, guys.",Pam
4742,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",That’s a really big decision.,Pam
4743,Let’s get this roof going.,Stop it!,Michael

4785,That’s ridiculous. I’m not going to be beaten by a website.,Actually it sounds like you are.,Jim
4786,"I understand. It’s in a blind spot because I’m trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I’m trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. This now I have an eye on. You see, it’s on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. I could come right out. I mean, I know you’re doing your job, but… Documentary Crew Member: It’s…",I’m doing my job.,Dwight

4811,"Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.","Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",Michael
4812,"If you want to fire him, you’re going to have to tell him yourself.","I don’t wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I’m certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just…",Michael

And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there’s another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man’s work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.",Michael
5825,"Oh, my God. You scared me.",Hear anything interesting?,Dwight

5842,"Well Andy’s desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it’s just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but…","Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",Pam

5858,Very valid.,…That’s it.,Pam
5859,Did you feel like crying?,No.,Dwight
5860,"Uh, I haven’t heard of that one.","Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",Dwight
5861,"Ok, see what I did?",No.,Jim
5862,"Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don’t know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving ’em free toner, and we keep ’em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better.

5876,"I can’t let you in, Michael.","Dwight, just…",Michael
5877,I just have a quick question.,"I haven’t signed them, ok?",Michael

5903,"Okay, deal! I’ll do whatever you say. No questions asked.","Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",Michael
5904,It is the situation that we are in now.,"So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don’t you?",Michael
5905,I won’t need to because we’ll be together playing hooky. Yeah.,"Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley!

5912,"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means “always be closing.”",This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,Dwight

Michael, you couldn’t even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn’t any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It’s like sometimes some of you act like I don’t even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we’re not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn’t have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn’t care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you’re with someone else. And that’s… fine. It’s… whatever. That’s not what… I’m not… Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I’m just trying to say to you, Jim… and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle.

It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be… a Bruce Springsteen fan – what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There’s a point there. But what is the point? I don’t understand what he’s saying.

6472,"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we’re on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it’s something that we should all be aware of. Ok?

6478,"If you don’t let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!",Good! Fine! I’ve got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee…,Jim
6479,My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I’m five months pregnant that I’m not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels–,"Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you’re so pretty.",Jim
6480,Why?,But she’s had a bad influence. She’s like an addict. And I just had to get her clean.,Pam

6492,Yeah.,That is neat.,Michael
6493,"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..","Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",Jim
6494,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",Wow. So much crap. It’s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,Dwight

6508,It’s always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,"Discipline. Kinky! All right, here’s the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",Michael
6509,What’s obvious? Why can’t Pam drink?,"Pam can’t drink? I didn’t– I shouldn’t have said that. I don’t know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn’t. She shouldn’t because she’s an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That’s not true. I– no. What we want– the real reason is that, that Pam’s pregnant.",Jim
6510,"Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.",Yes.,Jim

7717,I can’t even talk about it.,"You know it’s not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night.

7724,What are you gonna call him?,Dave.,Jim
7725,"Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.",He brought a sled.,Pam
7726,"Yeah, but why’d you give it to me?","I don’t know, it’s just…",Michael

7745,These are for employees only.,"Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.",Michael
7746,In your face!,We did it!,Michael
7747,"But, that’s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. Unless you want me to break protocol?","No, no. Give me the steam.",Dwight
7748,Do you like TCBY?,Who doesn’t?,Jim
7749,"I do, too. I do, too.",You do?,Jim
7750,Oh yeah? What’s the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?,Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane’s coming. I suppose you’re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?,Dwight

7772,Mr. Scott?,Yes.,Michael
7773,"So, what’s this presentation all about?","Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",Michael
7774,"Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes.",I would prefer not to.,Jim
7775,Were the boxes near each other?,Irrelevant.,Michael

7857,I don’t know. I got nephews.,Yeah.,Michael

8330,How do you spell “animalian”?,Animalian?,Jim
8331,I think you should get dressed.,I’m not getting dressed. I’m not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.,Michael
8332,"Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.","Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?",Dwight
8333,It’s not.,It is.,Michael
8334,Are you good?,"Yeah, I’m good. You good?",Michael
8335,You know what? Yeah. Have at it.,Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.,Dwight

8337,"Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.",You’re cheating. You’re cheating on me.,Michael
8338,"A wheel wants to spin, Pam.",Spinning would be more fun.,Jim
8339,The pressures of my office are insane.,Mm.,Dwight

8347,What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?,"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",Jim
8348,"Hey, Jim.","Hey guys, what’re we talking about?",Jim
8349,Stop just saying that.,"I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter.

No better, no worse.",Michael
8350,You can do this. You can do this.,"Pam, I’m scared. I’m real scared.",Jim

8352,We can do this with more privacy.,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don’t think so. We’re going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That’s the key.",Michael

8354,"Flower shops, fireworks celebrations…",Fence with a hole in it..,Dwight
8355,You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.,"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, “Hey, you know what, he’s right? What he’s doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.”",Michael
8356,"Dwight, I’m a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms…","Yeah, do tell.",Dwight

8363,Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?,"Everybody’s gonna be fine in exactly what they’re wearing, let’s go! Let’s go!",Dwight
8364,I’m not sure. It’s faux snakeskin.,"Snakes are waterproof. So, I’m betting that it’s waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?",Dwight
8365,"Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? You don’t think he could’ve used… it couldn’t have been…",Let’s just- let’s go.,Pam

8376,Ahh… I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.,Aww.,Pam
8377,Because you love her? Because you love her very much?,"All right, I’m gonna go now.",Jim
8378,"Woo! Hey, I haven’t gotten one yet!","Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.",Jim
8379,"Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?","No, I’m first mate. You’re second mate. I’m first mate, as the captain.",Michael
8380,"Okay, that is fine to feel, but not to act on.","It was unanimous, Toby.",Michael
8381,"Michael, I would like to be the elf.",That makes sense because he has elfish features.,Michael
8382,"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You’re like an Amish return stick.","OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?",Jim

8387,"No, it’s bad. Darryl canceled go-karting….",When were you going go-karting with Darryl?,Pam

8389,To my place?,"Maybe, I’m a little tired.",Pam
8390,Pam was supposed to get ’em.,"Okay. Well, when she comes back we’ll do it again. Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven’t had a hug all day.",Michael
8391,"And that Angela’s a midget, and that your chin is too big.",Hey.,Jim
8392,"I don’t care what you told them on the phone, that’s our policy.",You didn’t actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?,Michael
8393,Should we get toppings?,What do you like Pam?,Michael
8394,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.","Well, obviously. Too bad he’s a temp and doesn’t count, so let’s get started.",Jim
8395,"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I’m gonna make myself cry.","Andy, this is the deal we made.",Pam
8396,The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.,It involves you too.,Jim
8397,"And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.",So what is the problem?,Jim

8403,I spent three years in advertising before I came here.,"And that is probably why most ads suck. Oh, that’s them! Those are the ad guys right there.

8411,"I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can’t dock your pay. That’s not legal.",Very interesting.,Pam
8412,All right.,What do we got?,Michael
8413,He went to Gabe behind your back.,"No, he didn’t go behind my back. He went over my head.",Michael
8414,"I don’t know where they are, I think I threw them out.","Oh, no you di-int.",Michael

8480,"No, no, I’m okay. I’m all right. Okay… okay.","That was weird, huh? It’s all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right?

8509,"No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",No I disagree. “R” is among the most menacing of sounds. That’s why they call it “murder.” And not “muck-duck.”,Dwight

9130,What’s the hard way?,"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car.

9165,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.","Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don’t- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what?

9170,What?,"Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.",Jim
9171,"Look, Michael, I know you don’t want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.","Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I’m in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Brrr! That’s strong!",Michael
9172,"Did you shout, “Fire!”, causing a panic?","Yes I shouted “fire!”. I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what– heeded–",Dwight
9173,It’s a little loud…,Actually I think it’s not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!,Michael

9196,No.,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day.

9197,"Well, look closer.","Oh, ok.",Jim
9198,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.","Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she’s coming over here and she’s furious.",Dwight

9202,Excuse me.,"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",Michael
9203,Ok. Remember Spider face?,No.,Michael
9204,"Okay, I’m sorry, why are we discounting this whole “Woody came to life” thing so quickly?","Ahhhhhh! Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",Michael
9205,You have a toothbrush.,Yes.,Pam
9206,Yes.,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,Dwight
9207,That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!,Yep.,Dwight
9208,"That’s weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That’s not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal.

9216,"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. ‘Cause you never, ever talk about it.",Well I do.,Jim

9223,500 and one penny.,500 and one penny. One million dollar!,Michael
9224,"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.",Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.,Dwight
9225,"Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.","You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",Jim
9226,KGB.,"Dwight, get the door.",Michael

9230,"Oh no, it’s um…",Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.,Michael

9232,That’s awesome. You want some ice cream?,"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles’ flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That’s my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",Michael
9233,"Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.",Oh! So close to retirement.,Pam
9234,Huh?,Could I talk to you for a second?,Michael
9235,Are you coming?,"If you’ll have me, yes.",Michael
9236,"Drama queen, am I right?","Phillip, if you’re hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I’m dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it’s Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.",Dwight

9287,Wow.,Nice job.,Pam
9288,"Well we’re more following you guys, to see how you turn out.","Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don’t think anything’s gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there’s just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.",Pam

We were just at different places in our lives. No, I thought I’d be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo. She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale. Fresh outlook, and it’s all good.","Okay, so look that over, make sure it’s accurate.",Dwight
9314,"Michael, the pants don’t have any pockets.","No, they don’t. See?",Michael

9380,Quiet you.,"No, I mean, great detective work. ‘Cause this must be the first case you’ve ever cracked, right?",Jim
9381,"Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It’s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.","Hold on, hold on. Is this him?",Jim
9382,"It’s a joke, Dwight. It’s not a Sex Ed class.",But I’m right?,Dwight

9747,"“Robert, Hey!” Exclamation point.",I like it so far.,Pam

9749,Good.,"Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy – the child of which I have a vested interest. It’s all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly… fat and enormous right now – extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she’s here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I’m treating Ryan the same way.",Michael

10715,You never know. Better safe than sorry.,What are you thinking?,Jim
10716,"So, what’s Ryan doing here?","Oh, I dunno, they’re launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He’s being a real twerp about it, so, it’s all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",Michael

10746,No.,"Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I’m here. This is mine. Back off.",Dwight
10747,But so far we only have two pictures of him.,"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special.

Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and… getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That’s a great question.

10769,"Dwight, that’s awful.","You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it’s all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was “poisoned” by Aunt Shirley.",Dwight

15680,We did it!,We did it! We did it!,Michael
15681,"I don’t know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be… a Bruce Springsteen fan – what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There’s a point there. But what is the point?

15698,"Michael, I’m sorry.",And we did this whole stupid party for you.,Michael

15705,Where do you see yourself in ten years?,"Well, I’ve actually done a lot of thinking about that. And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids. And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth. And, because it’s the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.",Michael
15706,"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don’t respect the father who doesn’t respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",I don’t think you understand –,Jim
15707,Mmm! It’s after midnight.,You’re married. He’s married!,Michael

15718,When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that’s what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.,Oh I am. In my own words.,Dwight
15719,What are you doing?,"I don’t know, I think I was just staring at my desk.",Pam

15726,What drama?,"Between the – us and you guys. It’s unnecessary, right?",Jim
15727,I took the tags off already.,"Well, that’s not my fault, okay? Just.. we’re not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you’re all thinking, “Who is this smart little cookie?” Her name is Brenda… something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",Michael
15728,Hey. Where’d you go?,"Oh, just went to the bathroom.",Michael
15729,I’m your boss.,"My other boss, Mr. Figaro.",Michael
15730,At the Yankees game. Yeah.,"Yeah. Well, it wasn’t him.",Michael
15731,I went out to look for a better office space.,Waste of time.,Dwight

15739,"Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.",It’s a lullaby.,Dwight
15740,Jim.,I’ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I’d be proud to take.,Jim
15741,"It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I’ll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.",Hmm..,Michael
15742,Push!,"No, no, turn it around.",Michael
15743,"All right! I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be doing, but…","You are my producer, you are a suit. I am the creative genius. You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",Michael
15744,I mean you can tell.,"Yeah, I could tell.",Pam

15748,Where’s he gonna sit? There’s no more seats.,"He doesn’t need to sit, he’s a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",Michael
15749,Maybe some spagh-etti.,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn’t it? If I’d brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",Michael

15753,Dwight – awarded a point.,No.,Michael
15754,"Yeah, I know.","Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can’t just go right to the selling, you need “small talk.” What topics can you use for small talk?",Michael
15755,"You know, there’s no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don’t say anything about it.","Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",Jim
15756,And this is my workspace.,"This is it, check that out, can you smell that?",Michael

15773,Where did you get these facts?,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",Michael
15774,“…or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies. As was clearly stated in the official starting—“,Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!,Michael

16267,"Uh, it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a point if the company’s going under.",But if the company doesn’t go under then we’ll finally have all our contacts in one program.,Jim
16268,"I uh, I probably should have told you, I don’t need a ride now ’cause Jim can take me home after so you’re off the hook.","Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.",Michael
16269,"Three reams! Yoohoo… in your face, machines.",What kind of prank are you thinking?,Pam

16307,"Michael, are you that blind?","I’m not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he’s also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn’t, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.",Michael
16308,I didn’t know we had a tape measure.,“We” don’t.,Dwight
16309,No trades.,"Come on, it’s a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",Jim
16310,I’ll come visit you.,Okay. The annex it is. I’ll be sitting at your desk if that’s okay with you.,Jim

16320,No doy!,I’m just gonna call you back. Thanks.,Jim
16321,"Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I’ve always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?",I do. But you married my worst enemy.,Dwight

16330,Are you gonna add any more?,Nope.,Michael
16331,"I can help out, if you need me.","I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.",Michael
16332,"Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone’s on board.",Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,Michael
16333,Really?,Yes!,Michael
16334,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don’t you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",I can handle that.,Dwight

16340,"I could, but I just don’t feel like it loser.",Because you’re sitting?,Jim
16341,I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",Dwight
16342,"She asked me, Michael! It would’ve been rude not to answer.","You’ve been on the road a long time. And you’ve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can’t be peeing all over the walls.",Michael
16343,We should probably head back.,Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,Jim
16344,I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.,Oh. That’s nice.,Michael
16345,"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.",I could tell Jo… or I could tell Michael.,Pam
16346,What?,That’s right. Will you just give us a second?,Dwight
16347,"Right. Yeah. But, you know, I’ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I’ve earned this. I mean, you know?",You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I’m here.,Jim
16348,"What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.","Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",Jim
16349,Michael.,"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make ’em come to work, and we work ’em, and we make ’em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay ’em but we make ’em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it’s Christmas, but right after they’re back in the thick of it.",Michael
16350,Darn it!,Shoot!,Pam
16351,There’s nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the “grief counseling” session.,Oh. I would like a break.,Pam

16357,Do we understand each other?,Absolutely.,Michael
16358,Wait which one?,"I’m joking. I’m kidding around! I’m not actually angry. I’m not busy at all, I’m not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I’m a total Gleek.",Michael
16359,"A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let’s go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.",Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we’re the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that’s already been rode hard and put away muddy.,Dwight
16360,Uhm…,"Is it, is it because you’re afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you… to keep me grounded.",Michael
16361,"I haven’t heard that, Dwight.","If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy, and you can count on me.",Dwight
16362,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,Jim
16363,Of course. I’ll get you a bowl of pickles.,Thank you.,Michael
16364,"I wouldn’t know, I’m watching my weight. Ugh.","So you guys, you know what’s an even more useful treat…is cash. So-",Pam

16369,No.,"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?",Michael
16370,I was thinking exactly the same thing.,"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give ’em a taste of cat food pretty soon they’ll be back for the whole cat.",Dwight

16373,Is that really necessary?,I’ve almost had my nose broken a dozen times.,Dwight
16374,"What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",What?,Michael
16375,Then why isn’t he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?,He’s fine. He’s indestructible.,Jim
16376,I’m gonna take you home Michael.,Nope.,Michael
16377,No.,Now that’s going on?,Michael
16378,Is it true that you’re making Dwight the manager?,"No, why would you think that?",Jim
16379,Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!,Jim? No.,Pam
16380,Pam?,Yeah?,Pam
16381,All right!,"Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?",Jim
16382,Is that what happened to you?,"I’ll tell you what happened to me. I didn’t see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",Dwight
16383,Well I do.,Wow.,Dwight
16384,"Hey, I’m kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.","Roll in the hay, five dollars.",Dwight
16385,"Well you do a lot, so just don’t. Thank you. I know that I haven’t always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.","Barf! Ugh, you suck!",Pam
16386,I’ll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.,What’s that?,Jim

16388,I’m really looking forward to our interview.,And I’m really looking forward to working with you.,Michael
16389,"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.","Oh… well… okay… yeah, you know what? I don’t think… You.. You’re… My job sucks compared to this. I don’t think you’d like it up there.",Michael
16390,You understand this is a very serious situation.,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here’s the deal. It’s my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.",Michael
16391,And… go. Force it in as deep as you can.,That’s what she said.,Michael
16392,Yes. I would welcome it.,You’re welcome.,Jim
16393,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.","Hi. Wow, I really thought I’d be more excited to be here.",Pam
16394,"Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You’re gonna break it. Not bad, huh?",You did this for me?,Dwight

16397,"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",Both. They’re both worse.,Jim
16398,"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.

16407,"Well, uh… I don’t think any of us really know. Alright.",Is it… is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?,Pam
16408,We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.,"Okay, I’m gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn’t get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",Michael
16409,"Thanks, dude. You—you sure it’s okay? ‘Cause you’re kinda—","Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You’re clean, right?",Jim
16410,I am.,"Stop. Dwight. You know what? You’re acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He’s not your five year old brother, Dwight. He’s a valued member of this company… and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.",Michael
16411,I’m gonna set your face on fire.,"That’s a good one. Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?",Jim

16413,"What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.",Shh. Let’s not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I’m gonna dig it out of the trash!,Dwight
16414,"Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.","No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That’s all we know! No. That’s not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.",Dwight
16415,I can’t take it anymore.,"Wait, what? You can’t take what?",Dwight
16416,"Michael, I’m not gonna do that.",Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,Michael
16417,It’s fine.,"It’s like a prehensile wing or something, you know?",Dwight
16418,"Apparently, it’s one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist… That can’t be right. Andy? How does it…?","No, no. I want to hear you tell it.",Jim
16419,God. Mmm.,"Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn’t in the refrigerator. You wouldn’t know anything about that would you?",Jim

16422,One of us is out of here by the end of today!,Oh… kay…,Michael
16423,What do you think?,I think you’re right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.,Dwight
16424,Okay.,Really unlikely. But I can’t say that it’s impossible.,Pam
16425,"No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I’m gonna give him mouth to mouth.","No, no, no! Don’t give him mouth to mouth for this!",Jim

16432,Radiant.,Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.,Pam
16433,And we have homework.,"Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other’s sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam’s been doing to run the house while I’m in Philly.",Jim
16434,Ow! You hit people with that thing?,"No, I’m carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder",Dwight
16435,Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert – the only man that ever turned me down.,"Well, I don’t know about that. Just wasn’t for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",Jim

18790,That is my stapler.,"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",Michael

18800,They’re so not.,Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so…,Michael
18801,"Oh, that’s not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don’t ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.","Ok, give that back to me.",Dwight
18802,No rhyming!,Not really a rhyme.,Jim
18803,Oh ho ho! What?,I said happy birthday.,Pam

18815,Extreme! Parkour!,"This… is Parkour. Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It’s pretty impressive.

18816,Then I’ll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.,"Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?",Jim
18817,That’s it? That’s all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?,"All right, what’d you do?",Pam

18830,"No, that’s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about…",Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don’t see the point. It’s so Wall Street.,Dwight
18831,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That’s good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",That sounds nice.,Pam
18832,I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn’t doing so well.,Oh ok. For how long?,Michael
18833,You have to interview me…,I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,Jim

18840,It’s for you. From them.,Oh.,Dwight
18841,"Wow! Congratulations, that’s a really big step.","She’s got a ton of great qualities. She’s young, she’s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them.

18842,"Okay, bye. Okay, bye. I’ll miss you.",Miss you. Okay. I’ll be in my office if you need me.,Michael
18843,"Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don’t get there if you’re euthanized.","I know a great taxidermist. I’ll pay to have her stuffed. Well he’s not great, but he’s pretty good.",Dwight

18848,"No, I feel it’s my responsibility as your boss slash friend.","No, really, it’s okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",Pam
18849,Wow. Is that for the office?,"Oh, I know what you’re thinking. You’re not prying this out of my hands, but don’t tempt me because I’ll give it to you!",Michael

18862,I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.,To both these bears.,Jim
18863,Okay.,"No, you know what? You do it.",Dwight
18864,Like an AIDS test?,No! God.,Michael
18865,I don’t know.,"When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I’ve never said it out loud, so…",Michael
18866,Any luck?,No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.,Pam

18881,"News flash – If you didn’t carry it around for nine months, it isn’t your kid.","Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.",Pam
18882,"No. In fact, I’ll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.",What’s the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?,Dwight

18886,What?,"What do you mean, “what”?",Michael
18887,You were super mean.,It was insensitive and I am sorry.,Michael

20265,"‘Schruted’ it. It’s just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you ‘Schruted’ it.

20266,"Jim, how long? I have to go to the bathroom.","Well, he’ll be here really soon, Kev.",Jim

20288,That’s a lot of reasons!,Drink it!,Dwight
20289,Is she not going to like that?,No she’s going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,Pam

Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren’t really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn’t care. Society sucks. I don’t even consider myself a part of society. FYI.

20626,"Michael, if you hadn’t told us this, then we would’ve thought that you were actually firing him.","I’m not firing him. I’m not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I’m going to do, is I’m going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I’m teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That’s all I’m, okay, here he comes. Let’s just… play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?",Michael

20691,I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.,You know I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.,Dwight

22313,"Wait, Jim, no! Don’t drink directly from the can. Okay, I’m serious. It’s all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. Well, you’re an idiot.","What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.",Jim
22314,Ryan!,Fumble! Yaaah!,Dwight
22315,"Hmm, not much lumbar support.","Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",Michael

23265,Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,"Jim, you’re trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac.

23281,"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?

I had to walk home with no money and no phone.,"And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!",Dwight
24508,I can make myself cry.,Do that. Do it.,Michael
24509,"F and C, doubletime?",Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?,Michael
24510,Who wants Phyllis as Santa?,"No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we – Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?",Michael
24511,Oscar is out sick.,On a Friday?,Michael
24512,Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.,Mmmhmmm.,Michael
24513,You are not my superior.,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",Dwight
24514,Yeah.,When I was asking about the leads.,Dwight
24515,"Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good…","Pam, translate.",Michael
24516,"Dwight! Walk me out. Let’s talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it – it’s nice to have a little power, eh? How’s it feel?",Jo… I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.,Dwight
24517,"Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.",Yeah.,Michael
24518,"Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure?","Oh yeah, definitely.",Jim

24522,"Yeah, I didn’t think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.",Mmm-uh-mm,Dwight
24523,"Of course I am. I know you’re the mastermind, but you’re too stupid to do it by yourself.",: OK.,Jim
24524,"Oh, no, it was… you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to…","Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words.

24525,"But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.",Punishment fits the crime.,Jim
24526,What’s that?,You buy a purse.,Jim
24527,Read the receipt. That’s a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.,Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor’s had stolen from him?,Dwight
24528,Question. Won’t that interfere with your other task forces?,"Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know… I know what you’re thinking. Won’t that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don’t you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?",Dwight
24529,"Well, I just have to get through the binder.",Do you… just… you’re kind of losing them.,Michael
24530,"Oh coffee, that’s too much.","This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?",Dwight
24531,You wanted me?,Yes.,Michael

24534,You think it has something to do with that incentive program?,"Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.",Jim
24535,"Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin’ on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can’t explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin’ on. Tender love is blind—","It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh.",Michael
24536,"No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don’t you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside… and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.",Vamping.,Dwight
24537,"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",…I’ll consider it.,Dwight
24538,"It was a good idea, though.",Yeah. Here’s another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl’s idea.,Dwight
24539,I would say no.,"You say yes, and we go out.",Michael
24540,Pam! You can’t be serious.,"Michael, wait! I’m coming with you.",Pam
24541,"Well, two days minus how long we’ve been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.","Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?",Michael
24542,"I need to say, “What the hell is that? What the hell is that?”","Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",Pam
24543,"You know, we all do that.",I have herpes.,Michael
24544,Undo it!,I can’t change anything. This is the way…,Michael
24545,"Gentlemen, a word. Look, you guys are my closest friends in this office.",Right back at ya.,Jim
24546,There we go.,Okay.,Pam
24547,"Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?","That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.",Michael
24548,Do you really wanna know?,"Oh, God.",Jim
24549,"Uh, yeah.",Good. I need you to make five copies of these.,Dwight
24550,"Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.",Whoo!,Jim
24551,"No Michael, why would you promise that?","Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can’t go through with this.",Michael
24552,"Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.",Yeah.,Pam
24553,"Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there’s little evidence of that.",Is there some evidence?,Jim
24554,Live and learn.,It wasn’t. I swear.,Pam
24555,"Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We’ll be fine.","Jim, I don’t want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.",Pam
24556,Mmm hmm.,"I really heard him on that. This one’s interesting I’m not really sure what he meant by this. Um, “Dwight Schrute Privates.” Tough to say.",Jim
24557,Don’t…,Good shocks.,Dwight
24558,"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars ’cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn’t that affect the final… How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.",Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.,Michael
24559,"Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.",Yes.,Michael
24560,My parents were Mexican.,"Wow. That is… That is a great story. That’s the American Dream right there, right?",Michael
24561,I know.,"And even though… I came back, I just, I feel like I’ve never really… come back.",Jim
24562,Are you kidding? I’d come anywhere to see a turtle? Where’d you find him.,"There’s no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.",Dwight
24563,"Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don’t want to know. Tell me later. Let’s go! Let’s go! Hospital!","Okay, okay, we’re not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.",Pam

24571,You get something good this year?,I think I did a pretty good job.,Jim
24572,Yeah… I could.,Not Dwight.,Dwight
24573,"You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. It’s me own damn fault. Woman in every port.",What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por…,Dwight
24574,"That’s true. Um… dinner sounded delicious. Pam I’ll see you at home, thank you so much.","Oh Jim, I don’t think you’re going to abandon this party here all by itself.",Pam
24575,"One, and then wrap around. It’s okay. Hold that arm down.","I can’t. She’s too strong. She’s, careful, though. You don’t want to break it.",Jim
24576,Of course I checked it.,But more than once? ’cause you could have made a mistake.,Jim
24577,Yeah.,"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?",Michael
24578,"No, NO! I don’t want to touch you, ever consider that? You’re ignorant, and insulting, and small!","All right, um… sorry.",Michael
24579,Nope! Dance contest!,"All right, we’ll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!",Michael
24580,Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.,"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It’s just, I… I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",Michael
24581,You really wanna fight on Valentine’s Day?,"Yeah, I do.",Pam

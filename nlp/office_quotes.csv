1226,Michael?,Pam,True
1227,"I’m sorry I said that, I didn’t… just part of me meant it. Besides, he’d end up being a hero anyway.",Dwight,True

1270,Bye.,Jim,True
1271,What are you doing? Those are my keys.,Dwight,True

1278,"I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let’s be honest–if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob… I can pretty much sell anything.",Jim,True

1288,Natch.,Dwight,True
1289,Yeah!,Dwight,True
1290,"Oh, don’t worry about it. I mean, it’s better than listening to Michael play a conch shell… which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",Pam,True
1291,Oh.,Dwight,True
1292,"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan—",Michael,True
1293,Why?,Michael,True
1294,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",Michael,True

1301,"Dwight, not now, we’ve been robbed.",Michael,True
1302,"You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so… you know, let’s not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I’m still here-",Michael,True
1303,"For you, job well done.",Michael,True
1304,Bat birth control,Jim,True
1305,I am not budging on the hat issue.,Michael,True

1330,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",Jim,True
1331,"Our company is worth nothing. That’s the difference between you and I. Business isn’t about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.",Michael,True
1332,"She’s got a ton of great qualities. She’s young, she’s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we’re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn’t technically incest.",Dwight,True
1333,"No, you won’t, because he’s not picking up his phone.",Jim,True
1334,Yeah. Do you think she’s hot?,Pam,True

1343,Getting my wife a week off from work.,Jim,True
1344,...,Dwight,True
1345,Are you serious?,Dwight,True
1346,"Ah! Classic, right?",Jim,True

1349,You want rabies? Be my guest.,Dwight,True
1350,"No, we have to cancel the party.",Michael,True
1351,"Well, okay… And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.",Michael,True
1352,Did you even read the memo?,Dwight,True
1353,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",Dwight,True
1354,Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.,Dwight,True

1359,"You know what? You had your chance. You’re no leader. Out of your seat, let’s blast!",Dwight,True
1360,"Hey! Hi, good to see you.",Michael,True
1361,"Okay, uh, well, one is taken.",Michael,True
1362,So… what else is up? Mich-,Dwight,True
1363,"It looks like a It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!",Michael,True
1364,“I state my regret.”,Dwight,True
1365,Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?,Jim,True
1366,"Oh wow, you weren’t kidding.",Pam,True
1367,"I just want to know, from the horse’s mouth, what is the dealio?",Michael,True

1385,"Oh, yeah… Maybe.",Pam,True
1386,"Oh, okay.",Michael,True
1387,"They say the best vampires don’t bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.",Dwight,True
1388,"You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?",Jim,True
1389,"Wow. Um, ok.",Jim,True
1390,"Hey, I’m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim’s away. I’m in a position where I’m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",Pam,True

1396,Okay. Well… that’s random. I will dig into those later.,Michael,True
1397,Any emails today?,Michael,True
1398,Give me the dice!,Dwight,True
1399,"And… also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",Michael,True
1400,"I don’t like the tone here… this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.",Michael,True
1401,"What happened, did he do it?",Jim,True
1402,Nope.,Jim,True
1403,What would you have done? Been manager?,Dwight,True

1405,Aah!,Dwight,True
1406,"Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? … Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it’s just horrific. The doctor says he’d never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.",Dwight,True

1416,"What is Jim telling him? That I can’t handle this job? That ‘s bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately.

To retrieve… I left my cell phone here.",Michael,True
1417,I’m sorry. I had no idea.,Pam,True
1418,She missed you.,Pam,True

But you know what? It’s perfect. I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what? Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.

3132,Bye Michael! Yeah!,Dwight,True

No, seriously, guys, I’m not, I don’t want to go into it at all. It’s off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great.

3363,"I’m trying, but what you’re asking is–",Dwight,True
3364,Huh.,Pam,True

3366,Why?,Jim,True

3390,Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.,Pam,True

3411,"We’ll dig a trench. As long as it’s downhill from the well, we should be fine.",Dwight,True
3412,"Oh, sh… I’m sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then… Sprinkles! God, that’s 3 things.

3413,I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.,Michael,True

3419,"Come on, let’s go back to the party.",Michael,True
3420,And I don’t have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit… And we can’t just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,Michael,True

3423,"Alright, bye.",Michael,True
3424,"Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?",Dwight,True
3425,"Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.",Pam,True
3426,"Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.",Jim,True
3427,Microgement.,Jim,True

3438,Terrific. Good.,Michael,True

3440,"Oh, okay. Oh, do… that’s what the tape is for. I didn’t know.",Jim,True
3441,"Business is like a jungle. And I… am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger’s head. We don’t have the technology.",Michael,True
3442,Cool.,Pam,True
3443,"No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let’s just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.",Michael,True

3453,"Well, your office is behind you.",Jim,True
3454,What is October feast?,Michael,True
3455,"Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.",Dwight,True
3456,Yes. And don’t call me Shirley.,Michael,True
3457,"Um, I don’t think so, I just bought it.",Pam,True
3458,I’m sorry.,Jim,True

3467,On the phone.,Michael,True
3468,And to drink?,Jim,True
3469,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and… that’s nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.,Pam,True
3470,"You’re gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at… golfing. Are you a golfer?",Pam,True
3471,"Hi, can I help you?",Pam,True

3478,You really screwed that up.,Michael,True
3479,"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I’m busy, busy, busy. Can’t step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody’s doing. Everybody cool out there?",Michael,True
3480,"No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay Hey everybody!",Jim,True
3481,Maybe they are shrinking.,Michael,True
3482,"Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",Jim,True
3483,This… You know this is a scale of one to ten?,Michael,True
3484,"Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of “Serenity by Jan” What do you think about that?",Michael,True
3485,Right?,Jim,True
3486,It involves you too.,Jim,True
3487,Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.,Michael,True

3493,"Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.",Dwight,True
3494,"It’s a fake wheel, dummy.",Michael,True

3498,"Oscar, you don’t know what the hell you are talking about.",Michael,True

3545,"Now, were those for the team?",Jim,True

3582,Okay.,Jim,True
3583,"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It’s just this Office Administrator thing, I don’t wanna…",Pam,True

3586,"It’s nice to see you again, Dwight.",Pam,True

3606,"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make ’em come to work, and we work ’em, and we make ’em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay ’em but we make ’em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it’s Christmas, but right after they’re back in the thick of it.",Michael,True
3607,"Guys, come on, I’m on a date. Let me do my thang.",Michael,True

3663,Allergy to… the desk?,Jim,True
3664,"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I’m calling it crime-aid. It’s like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",Michael,True
3665,"Toby’s great. He’s great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. I don’t see the harm in that. Well, it’s a cake Toby, so, c’mon.",Jim,True

3712,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",Michael,True
3713,"Trick question! Cause you can’t always tell, so… how would I know. Is that the right answer?",Michael,True
3714,Hey it’s Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I’ve read a lot about this really great documentary.,Jim,True

3728,Yeah?,Jim,True
3729,Yep.,Jim,True

3745,"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn’t think you’d be there. Why, why are you still there?",Jim,True
3746,"A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.",Dwight,True
3747,I’m confused…,Pam,True
3748,"I dunno. I mean, maybe he’ll talk to you about some of this stuff ’cause he can’t really talk to me about it.",Pam,True

3762,"Well, you’ll figure it out.",Pam,True
3763,"Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I’ve cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So… what now?",Jim,True
3764,"My god, I’m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.",Jim,True
3765,"Oh, cause there’s a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.",Dwight,True
3766,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn’t able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.",Michael,True
3767,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?,Jim,True

3776,What are you up to?,Pam,True
3777,"Well, don’t look, freak!",Dwight,True
3778,"And Michael, you don’t have rabies. And chances are you’re not going to get it anytime soon. So… you don’t really have to think about it too much.",Pam,True

3808,"Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That’s what I have to say. Ah, Roy’s accepting.",Michael,True
3809,"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not… that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn’t exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",Michael,True
3810,"No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?",Michael,True
3811,"Okay, see you later.",Pam,True

3818,No thanks.,Jim,True
3819,And then another–,Michael,True
3820,It is the situation that we are in now.,Dwight,True
3821,"So, detour. We’re now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don’t think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! I’ve been driving too long.",Pam,True
3822,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,Dwight,True

3826,"Um… I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh… Karen from behind?",Michael,True
3827,"You know it’s not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night.

3828,"No, please, please…",Michael,True

3831,Who the heck was that?,Pam,True
3832,He wouldn’t listen to me,Dwight,True
3833,"No, no, I think it was more like, ‘you know, I liked him, but I don’t anymore because he did a bad job, so I’m definitely gonna yell at him’.",Jim,True
3834,"Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin’ tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don’t we watch that show that you’ve been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.",Michael,True

3846,Learn to cook for one!,Pam,True
3847,"No, see? Right there, that’s the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don’t know if you’re saying “Sea World” or “see the world,” and it’s taking a lot of time to explain it.",Jim,True
3848,Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,Jim,True
3849,"You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.",Michael,True
3850,"Okay. There’s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.",Jim,True
3851,Yes.,Jim,True
3852,Ok.,Jim,True
3853,Michael.,Dwight,True
3854,Of course.,Dwight,True

3904,So. Uh… I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I’m going yet. It’s kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?,Jim,True
3905,"Allow me. You’re going to love this. Ugh…should’ve used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else’s work.",Dwight,True

7309,It would look bad. Sorry.,Jim,True
7310,I could have helped.,Michael,True

7321,"Okay, don’t be nervous, just picture her naked.",Michael,True
7322,Thank you.,Dwight,True

7328,Take it easy.,Jim,True
7329,"Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.",Michael,True
7330,Oh.,Pam,True
7331,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, “Wow, he is so great.” And I was gonna say, “Well, it’s in the genes.” And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I’d point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don’t want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.",Michael,True
7332,"Yeah. Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office.",Pam,True
7333,"I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.",Michael,True
7334,"Of course you do, moon face. That’s because you’re a preppy freak, you’re the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.",Dwight,True

7347,We hired you for three hours work and we’re going to get it.,Dwight,True
7348,"Oh, this is just something I’m taking a break with.",Jim,True
7349,I’d prefer for him to think of it as degrading.,Dwight,True
7350,"Michael… You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?",Dwight,True
7351,It’s called being smart.,Pam,True

7354,"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",Michael,True
7355,"Yeah, I could tell.",Pam,True
7356,"You’re gonna like this. “Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. ‘What’s next?’, you’re probably wondering. Don’t be scared of you’re night in heaven–”",Dwight,True

7367,"Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.",Michael,True
7368,Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!,Michael,True
7369,"Here’s what we think happened. Michael’s sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who’s causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn’t work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.",Pam,True
7370,Now he is saying “Hi” louder.,Jim,True
7371,"Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?",Jim,True

7399,… your problem.,Pam,True
7400,Maybe put up some shelves.,Jim,True
7401,"Oh! Wow. Awesome. For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.",Michael,True
7402,"Yeah. That’s what we’re doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",Jim,True
7403,"Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.",Michael,True
7404,I don’t think that’s a word.,Pam,True

7410,Ah!,Pam,True
7411,Kevin.,Michael,True
7412,Don’t want it. Won’t open it. Don’t need it. Won’t take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.,Dwight,True
7413,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,Michael,True
7414,We know that.,Jim,True
7415,Yeah.,Michael,True
7416,"That’s the whole point, dummy.",Michael,True
7417,I don’t care whether you hate it! You said you’d do it!,Michael,True

7419,Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you’re saying?,Michael,True
7420,Hope – grows.,Dwight,True
7421,I’m sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.,Dwight,True
7422,Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!,Michael,True
7423,You think your doctor’s going to give you a C-section at six months?,Pam,True
7424,They sent a limo.,Michael,True

7426,I vouched for you.,Michael,True

7431,Baquette.,Jim,True
7432,"Apparently, it’s one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist… That can’t be right. Andy? How does it…?",Dwight,True
7433,I got his pants.,Michael,True
7434,"Yeah, that’s what I had for breakfast and I think that’s probably why I’m still hungry.",Jim,True
7435,She totally got me. She understood that we didn’t have to laugh to enjoy —,Michael,True
7436,…wall-to-wall carpets…,Michael,True
7437,"Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he’s a little… Little dim. He’s the janitor’s brother, so…",Michael,True

7439,KGB.,Dwight,True
7440,Thanks.,Michael,True
7441,And many more!,Michael,True
7442,I’m between specialists right now.,Michael,True

7445,"Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!",Michael,True
7446,Shove it through! Break it!,Dwight,True
7447,"I don’t wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I’m certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just…",Michael,True
7448,Of course.,Michael,True
7449,All right.,Michael,True
7450,So the kid’s making the noise to pick it up.,Michael,True
7451,I sent in one of my watercolors.,Pam,True
7452,What are you doing?,Michael,True
7453,"Uh, sure.",Pam,True
7454,Do you?,Jim,True
7455,"Then listen to your iPod, Pam.",Michael,True
7456,But it is already three o’clock!,Michael,True
7457,Cocks in the henhouse.,Dwight,True
7458,But check that it’s covered by your,Dwight,True

7460,Good afternoon!,Jim,True
7461,Good night Vikram.,Michael,True
7462,"Wait, it’s that easy? That’s not a resolution, that’s just… something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that… My resolution is… meet a loose woman.",Dwight,True
7463,"Ok it’s because we haven’t sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they’re gonna pay anything.",Michael,True
7464,You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?,Michael,True
7465,How dare you?,Dwight,True
7466,I would love that.,Michael,True
7467,"Oh, that’s appropriate. Lot of fire where you’re going. Better get used to it. You’re going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You’re going to Hell Stanley.",Michael,True
7468,Who.,Michael,True
7469,"Ex-husband, you have to let it go.",Michael,True
7470,What? Shut up.,Michael,True
7471,So can you watch this? I’m gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.,Dwight,True
7472,"I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.",Dwight,True
7473,Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.,Dwight,True

7477,You were making me do things that were not all right.,Dwight,True
7478,Oh my God.,Michael,True
7479,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They’re deformed, and they’re abnormal, and… they’re illiterate and ugly.

7480,"Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it’s barely three pounds.",Dwight,True

7487,"Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn’t a concussion.",Dwight,True

7508,"Great. Cool. Cool. Yeah, okay.",Michael,True
7509,A little eye for an eye action.,Dwight,True
7510,"Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it’s cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.",Michael,True
7511,"No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would’ve happened with me and Jim if he didn’t put himself out there.",Pam,True
7512,"Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.",Dwight,True
7513,To one without a cubicle.,Jim,True
7514,"No, they don’t. See?",Michael,True
7515,What?,Dwight,True
7516,"Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl….",Dwight,True
7517,One of Toby’s eyes is getting smaller. So there’s that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I’ll keep you posted on that.,Dwight,True
7518,"All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.",Michael,True
7519,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I’ll approve the overages. Sound good?",Michael,True

7526,"Oh, that’s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",Michael,True
7527,"You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don’t matter to him, because we’re just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. I’m okay. No, I’m not.",Michael,True
7528,No I didn’t.,Jim,True
7529,Really? How did– how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?,Michael,True
7530,"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs… so, good news, right?",Pam,True
7531,Something with a “K”.,Michael,True
7532,I knew it. Is it waterproof?,Dwight,True
7533,"No, not more than anything.",Jim,True
7534,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,Michael,True
7535,Yeah.,Pam,True
7536,"I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.",Michael,True
7537,"No, I was being negligent. But she’s in the hospital, she’s fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in…",Michael,True
7538,I am not gonna do this.,Jim,True
7539,Ditto. How are you Jan?,Michael,True
7540,"I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret… you reply, “Absolutely, I do.”",Pam,True

7558,You got that?,Michael,True
7559,"Sorry, I forgot Kevin’s extension. It’s a fantasy football thing.",Jim,True
7560,"Win at all costs, don’t respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that’s how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.",Dwight,True
7561,Wow.,Jim,True
7562,It’s Alex.,Pam,True
7563,Oh please! You’re not taking any trip.,Dwight,True

7572,"No, I won’t even consider it.",Michael,True
7573,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t’s and dot some i’s. Alright, I’m going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That’s my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",Michael,True
7574,"OK, thank you for … this.",Jim,True

7591,Wow.,Pam,True
7592,"Oh, lazy. Uh huh.",Michael,True
7593,Are you nuts?,Dwight,True
7594,Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,Jim,True

14139,"Yes, I… Do you want to…",Jim,True
14140,"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that’s me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",Michael,True
14141,"I think they’re even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don’t really know how to compare those units.",Pam,True

14156,No.,Pam,True
14157,"What do I do with my bonus check? Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year’s bonus even bigger. Eventually, I’ll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I’ll use the paper to write my memoirs.",Dwight,True
14158,"Well, what should I do?",Michael,True
14159,That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It’s white hot.,Jim,True
14160,No.,Dwight,True
14161,It is?,Michael,True
14162,"Kelly. Kev- Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I’ve been raising children since I was a baby.",Dwight,True

14167,Who else we got?,Jim,True
14168,Why don’t you just get rid of this guy?,Dwight,True

14170,"Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.",Michael,True
14171,Assistant Regional Manager.,Dwight,True
14172,Toby can I see those? Ooh. What’s the matter? What’s the matter? You scared?,Michael,True
14173,"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",Pam,True
14174,"You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.",Michael,True
14175,Uh-huh.,Michael,True
14176,"No, I will.",Michael,True
14177,"Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!",Michael,True

14188,"Um… no. No, he has a girlfriend.",Pam,True
14189,And that isn’t weird?,Jim,True
14190,"Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.",Dwight,True

14192,"Yep, I did say that.",Jim,True
14193,"You okay, Robert?",Dwight,True
14194,Hey.,Jim,True
14195,I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I’ll get back to you. That is all.,Dwight,True
14196,Saint Bernard.,Michael,True
14197,Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is…,Jim,True

14214,"Thanks, mom!",Pam,True
14215,"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.",Jim,True
14216,"Well, with her being unmarried… knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.",Jim,True
14217,This is plenty complicated.,Michael,True
14218,Yes. Of course.,Dwight,True
14219,We should probably stop by. It’d mean a lot to him.,Jim,True
14220,"No, he’s not.",Michael,True

14279,"Ok. Oh, god.",Dwight,True
14280,Great.,Jim,True

The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn’t want it to continue for some reason.

17888,"Oh, I’m kind of in the middle of — yes please.",Pam,True
17889,"You will say ‘yes’ on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say ‘yes’, one. Yes.",Dwight,True
17890,"By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.",Jim,True
17891,Oh–,Pam,True
17892,Why don’t you explain this to me like I’m five.,Michael,True
17893,You having fun?,Michael,True
17894,"Please, don’t.",Dwight,True
17895,"No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.",Dwight,True
17896,"We’ll see. You are an assistant who’s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.",Jim,True
17897,I need to pee.,Michael,True
17898,"Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.",Michael,True
17899,Mmhm.,Jim,True
17900,Whassup!,Michael,True
17901,"OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?",Michael,True
17902,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who’s getting a better job offer. Like, for real.",Pam,True
17903,"Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.",Jim,True
17904,Stop drinking the water! Stop!,Pam,True
17905,"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that’s my joke.",Michael,True
17906,Who eats eight protein bars?,Michael,True
17907,Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!,Dwight,True
17908,"Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don’t think he is a snappy dresser.",Michael,True
17909,Okay. Am I shiny?,Michael,True
17910,Well…,Michael,True
17911,Thank you.,Michael,True
17912,When are you ever responsible for your actions?,Pam,True
17913,"Because without Andy’s mom, there’s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",Michael,True
17914,"Maybe I did. Maybe I called him, I don’t know.",Michael,True
17915,"Seven minutes. … Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. .",Dwight,True
17916,Big…,Michael,True
17917,Thank you.,Pam,True
17918,"Dwight, don’t be gross.",Jim,True
17919,"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.",Jim,True
17920,"Oh. Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!",Michael,True
17921,It’s the European cut.,Michael,True
17922,Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.,Dwight,True
17923,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",Dwight,True
17924,Okay.,Jim,True
17925,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.",Dwight,True
17926,"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter…",Dwight,True
17927,"Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?",Jim,True
17928,I take full responsibility.,Dwight,True
17929,"Oh, yeah?",Jim,True
17930,"Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.",Jim,True
17931,I don’t think that’s a good idea.,Pam,True
17932,"Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?",Michael,True
17933,"Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?",Michael,True
17934,Oh.,Dwight,True
17935,"Heh, okay, weirdo.",Michael,True
17936,I don’t care. Bury it. I hope you’re happy.,Michael,True
17937,"Not much, what’s up with you?",Michael,True
17938,"Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative.",Michael,True
17939,Jan knows paper.,Dwight,True
17940,"Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.",Michael,True
17941,"Michael, you don’t have to do this.",Jim,True
17942,I can.,Jim,True
17943,It was an away game.,Jim,True
17944,Ssshh stupid! Um…,Michael,True
17945,The coffee in Paraguay is colder?,Dwight,True
17946,Bye.,Michael,True
17947,"Just do it, okay?",Michael,True
17948,Not really. It’s kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.,Pam,True
17949,"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could’ve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",Michael,True

17951,I hate you.,Pam,True
17952,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",Jim,True

17954,"Yes, you did.",Dwight,True
17955,Uh…,Pam,True
17956,"Oh, God, I hope it’s urine.",Michael,True
17957,"Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.",Pam,True
17958,pum pum pum pum pum pum pum,Dwight,True
17959,"Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, “I have cancer.”",Michael,True
17960,"Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn’t left India.",Michael,True
17961,"Sure I’m a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good.",Jim,True
17962,"I know. I know, I’m sorry about that. That was terrible.",Michael,True
17963,"Nothing. Just checking in. I can’t tell you, so…",Michael,True
17964,That’s kind of an impossible question.,Jim,True
17965,The nerve.,Pam,True
17966,But we’re bonding down there!,Michael,True
17967,"Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!",Michael,True

17972,"Oh, damn. They’ve been in there for like ten minutes.",Pam,True
17973,Nana?,Pam,True
17974,She’s engaged.,Jim,True
17975,"Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.",Michael,True

17984,Yeah. Guess it is.,Pam,True
17985,"Can I help you, Michael?",Pam,True
17986,Where?,Dwight,True
17987,Thank you.,Pam,True
17988,"Mose, bags! Now!",Dwight,True
17989,"If I didn’t do certain things without telling Pam, she’d be married to Roy.",Jim,True
17990,Can we have another? I think I blinked.,Michael,True
17991,"Yeah, do it!",Michael,True
17992,Haahh!!,Dwight,True
17993,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that’s insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",Dwight,True
17994,"I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!",Michael,True
17995,Get it over with. Then we don’t have to hide anymore.,Dwight,True
17996,Ooh… fancy.,Jim,True
17997,"Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So… oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. ‘M’ is for Murder, ‘P’ is for…",Michael,True
17998,No.,Michael,True
17999,"What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.",Jim,True
18000,"Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.",Dwight,True
18001,It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.,Michael,True
18002,Dad?,Dwight,True
18003,"Um, I don’t know if I really see you two together.",Pam,True
18004,"I know, I know you’re angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.",Michael,True
18005,"We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It’s like another seven hours.",Michael,True
18006,"Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.",Michael,True
18007,Not gonna happen.,Michael,True
18008,"Okay, this is it. This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he’s like “Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You’re a bad person.” It’s very dramatic. Although, I can’t say I was a big fan of ‘Bowling for Columbine’, because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like ‘Kingpin’. And it wasn’t. It was something else.",Michael,True
18009,Yeah.,Jim,True
18010,I’m doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?,Jim,True
18011,Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.,Dwight,True
18012,"This is actually a big potential sale, so…",Jim,True
18013,Is it a good plan?,Michael,True
18014,Go put them all in random order.,Dwight,True
18015,You know what? You’re just lucky that we are at work right now.,Michael,True
18016,I don’t need a gun.,Michael,True
18017,Can you give us a hint?,Jim,True
18018,Sounds good.,Jim,True
18019,"Oh right, that’ll take a couple of weeks.",Dwight,True
18020,You can’t tantalize me.,Dwight,True
18021,It’s not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,Michael,True
18022,"So… Hey come on, don’t be sad, just… OK… just. She’s in a better place.",Dwight,True
18023,"That’s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don’t vibrate at all.",Dwight,True
18024,Oh!,Michael,True
18025,What do we got here?,Jim,True
18026,That’s right! Doing! Totally doing! It’s rock n’ roll!,Dwight,True
18027,"Yeah, well, that’s not gonna happen. That’s not gonna happen. We’ll be back with some answers. I – ok. I know that you’re mad at me and you’re mad at all them –",Michael,True
18028,Packer.,Dwight,True

18032,"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",Pam,True
18033,"Deangelo’s great. I love the guy. But I’m not sure he’s a great fit for the office. And also, I’m not sure if I love the guy.",Michael,True
18034,"Well, in an ideal world…",Jim,True
18035,"Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So…",Dwight,True
18036,"Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.",Jim,True
18037,I would like it off my desk.,Pam,True
18038,Right.,Jim,True
18039,"I color code all my info. I wrote “gay son” in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means “Orange you glad you didn’t bring it up?” Most colors mean “Don’t say it.”",Michael,True
18040,"Yeah, I hear ya. It’s been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you’re hurting…",Michael,True
18041,"Yeah, I know. I know.",Michael,True
18042,"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we’ll stop.",Michael,True
18043,"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I’m in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Brrr! That’s strong!",Michael,True
18044,Done.,Dwight,True
18045,Ouchy.,Michael,True
18046,"I… uh, well, I don’t know.",Michael,True

18050,That was awesome. Thank you.,Michael,True
18051,"I’m moving out to the burbs… actually, I’m moving further than the burbs, I’m moving to Colorado.",Michael,True
18052,Okay.,Pam,True
18053,I wouldn’t understand or a secret?,Jim,True
18054,This is gonna be awful.,Jim,True
18055,Joe Montana!,Pam,True
18056,I will seduce her.,Michael,True
18057,"Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine’s Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.",Michael,True
18058,Pass.,Michael,True
18059,I don’t know.,Michael,True
18060,Yep.,Jim,True
18061,Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,Dwight,True
18062,"That’s, that is true.",Michael,True
18063,Yeah that seems fair.,Pam,True
18064,"Well, let’s…",Michael,True
18065,Michael’s birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don’t know… It was a good day.,Pam,True
18066,You broke up with AJ weeks ago.,Michael,True
18067,I know. Isn’t that always how it goes?,Pam,True
18068,"OK… Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it’ll fit, with all these little knickknacks.",Michael,True
18069,Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.,Michael,True
18070,You want me to be happy?,Michael,True
18071,"As ranking number three in this office, I am order –",Dwight,True
18072,Yes.,Michael,True
18073,I’m trying to think of what we could sell.,Michael,True
18074,"Oh no, no, no.",Dwight,True
18075,Let’s go.,Dwight,True
18076,What?,Dwight,True
18077,Hey! We need to get you dressed!,Pam,True
18078,Which is you.,Jim,True
18079,that’s great.,Jim,True
18080,"Pam, what you don’t understand is that at my level you just don’t look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.",Michael,True
18081,"God, you’re such a spy.",Dwight,True
18082,Is that where the nanobots like to come in?,Dwight,True
18083,Can you stop this?,Michael,True
18084,I am not going to tell you anything.,Michael,True
18085,Hey Santa!,Dwight,True
18086,"Oh, you are such mench my friend.",Michael,True
18087,Pam? Pam?,Michael,True
18088,I know. I know what to do.,Pam,True
18089,He’s hard of — he’s an old man. Let’s go.,Michael,True
18090,We decided that there’s no way Dwight would harm a child.,Pam,True
18091,"That’s not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you’re an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don’t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it’s not fair to people with rabies. And that’s the point, right? OK, let’s go have some fun.",Michael,True
18092,Ah-ha.,Pam,True
18093,I like where you’re going with this. Continue.,Dwight,True
18094,"No, no, I don’t, but—",Michael,True
18095,Don’t you realize the key is inside you?,Dwight,True
18096,Yes. I would welcome it.,Dwight,True
18097,I understand that.,Jim,True
18098,"I… you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.",Michael,True
18099,"Not on the inside he’s not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",Dwight,True
18100,To change lives.,Michael,True
18101,"Oh, no, absolutely.",Jim,True
18102,Uh huh.,Michael,True
18103,And in this case…,Jim,True
18104,"No, it’s not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",Michael,True
18105,Wanna head back?,Michael,True
18106,Trip Advsior.,Pam,True
18107,"Ah, ah, ah. Where’s the “please”? We’re not animals.",Jim,True
18108,"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let’s not tell anybody about this right now.",Michael,True
18109,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,Dwight,True
18110,"Don’t-all right. Well, ok, you’ve just committed a felony.",Michael,True
18111,We are great together. We are a great team.,Michael,True
18112,"You ready? And we’re off, like a herd of turtles.",Michael,True
18113,"A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing…",Michael,True
18114,False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!,Dwight,True
18115,"I was blue group, so it was second from the top.",Jim,True
18116,"Man, he is late. I’m gonna call him. Do you mind? I’m sorry.",Michael,True
18117,"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn’t you? Skeevy little perv.",Michael,True
18118,"Oh, okay.",Michael,True
18119,I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,Dwight,True
18120,You down with the Dundies? You’re all my homies,Michael,True
18121,So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.,Michael,True
18122,"Oh yeah, your mom would love that.",Pam,True
18123,"I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn’t wait… Oh, God, don’t be mad.",Pam,True
18124,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",Michael,True
18125,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,Jim,True
18126,Wow.,Pam,True
18127,And that’s why you have an assistant regional manager.,Dwight,True
18128,I already have my European girlfriend.,Michael,True
18129,Yeah Jim.,Dwight,True
18130,Okay– just– don’t ever date a member of my family again.,Pam,True
18131,Maybe it should come from a man.,Pam,True
18132,Wouldn’t that be fun?,Michael,True
18133,Dwight. Michael will be out in a second.,Pam,True
18134,We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends —,Jim,True
18135,I’m really too tired to do this.,Jim,True
18136,"No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time. This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it’s what it’s all about, just hangin’ out. Enjoying friends, all being the same. Worker bees.",Michael,True
18137,Oh! I… uh… yeah. Um… I’ll uh show them to you later.,Pam,True
18138,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",Michael,True
18139,Thank you.,Michael,True
18140,You’re the boss. Don’t you think we’d all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?,Jim,True
18141,"Pam, please call security!",Dwight,True
18142,In. I’m hungry.,Dwight,True
18143,"Um, about the beach…",Pam,True
18144,Yes it was.,Michael,True

18150,Yes.,Dwight,True
18151,I know.,Dwight,True
18152,Hi buddy.,Jim,True
18153,"Michael, what’s wrong?!",Dwight,True
18154,Yeah…,Jim,True
18155,"That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you’ll be punished less.",Dwight,True
18156,"Pam, Pam, it’s time. Let’s go to the hospital.",Jim,True
18157,Tony the tiger. You don’t hear that much any more.,Jim,True
18158,"I wasn’t given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren’t allowed to see movies. So… do the math.",Dwight,True
18159,Alright.,Jim,True
18160,"Yeah, but in a jokey way where you’re gonna start singing.",Pam,True
18161,I hope you got sound on everything. I’d love a DVD of that.,Pam,True
18162,I don’t like that at all.,Michael,True
18163,Three times.,Jim,True
18164,Helene?,Michael,True
18165,I’m not going to do that.,Pam,True
18166,"I can’t. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!",Dwight,True
18167,You were in an a capella group?,Pam,True
18168,Angela as the nurse!,Pam,True
18169,Uh huh.,Michael,True
18170,"Shh, shh, shh.",Pam,True
18171,Those are collectible action figures and they’re worth more than your car.,Dwight,True
18172,Yeah.,Michael,True
18173,"Yes, I was watching Jim’s face.",Michael,True
18174,Thanks. You don’t need to stay here.,Pam,True
18175,"No, what happened with Donna?",Michael,True
18176,"Yes, yes I do. I love that song. First I was afraid, I was petrified.",Michael,True
18177,"Very nicely done. I think that’s H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.",Jim,True
18178,"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",Pam,True
18179,But then no one can see us.,Dwight,True
18180,Yes!,Dwight,True
18181,We already have a buyer.,Michael,True
18182,Well.,Michael,True

The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. That’s great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I’d buy a dictionary.

And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You’re wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don’t feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn’t joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me.

21789,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don’t have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it’s good for me. It’s the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot… that’s it. I don’t see what’s so hard to believe about that.",Michael,True

21795,Phyllis!,Pam,True
21796,"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she’d ask you what you wanted, you would say probably “freedom.” At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It’s a good thing Russia doesn’t exist anymore.",Michael,True
21797,"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan’s been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.",Dwight,True
21798,"Take that, Saddam!",Dwight,True
21799,Okay.,Jim,True

21815,Trees! And where do trees grow?,Dwight,True
21816,Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.,Dwight,True
21817,Mm-hmm.,Michael,True
21818,"Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?",Dwight,True
21819,Really?,Jim,True
21820,"When I retire, I… don’t want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.",Michael,True

21822,"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.",Jim,True
21823,Try not to be so hurtful Jim.,Michael,True

21833,Kay.,Pam,True
21834,"Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids…drinking whiskey and rye, oh why’d you have to go off and die? Why’d you have to go off and die?",Michael,True
21835,So I can lower it.,Dwight,True
21836,"Okay! Well this isn’t my best, but call Froggy101, say that we’re the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we’re giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it’s his own number.",Jim,True

22033,That’s increadible.,Jim,True
22034,"How do you un-tell something? You can’t. You can’t put words back in your mouth.
